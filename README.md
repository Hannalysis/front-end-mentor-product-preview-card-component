### The challenge

<i>The Original - Desktop Design:</i>

<i>The Original - Active States:</i>
  
![](./images/active-states.jpg)

Your challenge is to build out this product preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size (for desktop only)
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

### What I learned

As this was my first real CSS challenge outside of the Landing Page project in The Odin Project Foundations course, I wanted to break down this task into a few actionable todo points:

<h5><u>Main Challenge</u></h5>

- Create the essential containers, and centre the content in the middle of the page
- Get the main content box shape correct, and soften the applicable corners 
- Get rid of any unnecessary scrolling of the page, and ensure the content remains centered 
- Add the remainder of the text elements, fonts and necessary containers inside product information container (right-facing container)
- Pull out the pricing elements separately so they can be uniquely modified
- Touch up with final styling and formatting changes; ensure that all the text, button and pricing inside the product information container are left aligned together

<h5><u>Update 1</u></h5>

<p><i>When I came back to this project a couple of days later to update this README file, I realised I had forgotten to implement the active-states part of the challenge!</i><p>

- Add Active Styling to the Cart Button (aka hover with darken and cursor set to pointer)

<h4><u>Code snippets of note</u></h4>

The snapshot css below represents what I needed to do to achieve not just the main centered containers soft edges, but with the left side of the image almost mirroring those soft edges, with a few px short so it fits inside appropriately.

```css
.centre-container{
...
    border-radius: 16px;
}
.product-image {
    border-style: double;
    border-color: hsl(30, 38%, 92%);
    border-top-left-radius: 12px; /* To soften the left side border on the img */
    border-bottom-left-radius: 12px; /* To soften the left side border on the img */
    ...
}
```
The example below was my first practical use case of space-between. Once I realised I could utilise this property in this situation, it felt great to remove the redundant numeral margins/gaps etc within this container, in favour for this spacing technique.

```css
.product-information-container {
    padding: 40px;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: space-between;
}

```

### Continued development

<h5><u>Update 2 - 2025/08/04</u></h5>

- Mobile Implementation
- Custom CSS properties
- Minor styling fixes

Next, I'd like to refactor this project so it's mobile first, which matches my approach for my other FE mentor challenges.
